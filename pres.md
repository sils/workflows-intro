# About Me

# We use Git

## Version Control System (VCS)

Learn about Git at <http://bit.ly/1Y6q7CA>.

# Control Contribution

## Access Management

- Fork
- Branch

## Pull Request

- Somebody *else* than contributor controls if it goes in.


# Testing

## Why?

- Release without worries.
- Without, bugs *will* reoccur.

## How?

- Unittests
- **Documentation Tests**

## Automate!

- Continuous Integration
- Test against different environments

# A Glimps Into the Future: Verification

## What's That!?

- Prove software formally.
- Pre-, Postconditions
- Invariants
- ...

## That's a Lot of Work!

**Yes!**

# Review

## Why?

- Verify that code is understandable.
- Improve quality.

## Commit Messages

## Automate

# Commit History - Merge vs. Rebase

## Merge

GitHub wants you to do it.

## Rebase

I want you to do it:

- Clean History
- Linear History
- Good Tracability!

# Releasing

## Tracing Changes

Updating `CHANGELOG`s sucks!

- Track a wiki page.
- Maintainer updates on release.

## Backporting

Fix bugs in old releases.

- Cherry Pick

## Automate

# Documentation

## Write

Combine with unittests - doctest!

## Automate

# Talking to Each Other

## Channels

IRC like.
